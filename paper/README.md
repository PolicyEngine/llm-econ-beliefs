Canonical manuscript: `paper.qmd`.

Supporting files:

Rebuild tables from the current `results/` CSVs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/.. python3 build_tables.py
```

(any Python 3.11+ interpreter with the project dependencies installed will work; `/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin/python3.14` is an example of a specific interpreter that has been verified locally.)

The flat-tax and optimal-top-rate tables call into a separate PolicyEngine-US venv. By default the script looks for the repo at `~/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us` and the venv Python at `~/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us/.venv/bin/python`. Override either via the `POLICYENGINE_US_REPO` and `POLICYENGINE_US_PYTHON` environment variables. If the venv is missing the script prints a warning to stderr and falls back to stylized Pareto parameters for the affected tables.

Render the manuscript:

```bash
/Users/maxghenis/quarto/bin/quarto render paper.qmd
```

Quarto is installed at `/Users/maxghenis/quarto/bin/quarto` locally and is not on the default shell `PATH`. The manuscript renders to `paper.html`; the bare `render` command does not rebuild the committed `paper.pdf`, so after any prose change also run:

```bash
/Users/maxghenis/quarto/bin/quarto render paper.qmd --to pdf
```

After rebuilding, run the prose-consistency gate from the repo root:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify_paper_prose.py
```

## Core question

If you ask a frontier LLM for a canonical economic parameter, what prompt-conditioned response distribution does it produce?

That distribution has at least four parts:

- a central estimate
- an uncertainty interval
- a choice of interpretation when the parameter name is ambiguous
- a set of literature anchors it claims to rely on

## Initial parameter families

- labor supply
- household preferences
- production
- taxation
- trade
- macro persistence and growth

## Calibration appendix

Calibration lives in the repo but is secondary to raw elicitation.

- main text: raw elicited distributions over economic quantities
- methods appendix or secondary section: post-hoc calibration on resolved numeric tasks

The default calibration object is the pooled predictive distribution, not the uncertainty around a latent consensus mean. Good default losses and diagnostics are pinball loss for elicited quantiles, weighted interval score for central intervals, and PIT diagnostics with empirical-PIT recalibration for full pooled CDFs.

Raw distributions stay primary; calibrated distributions are a secondary, externally corrected object.
