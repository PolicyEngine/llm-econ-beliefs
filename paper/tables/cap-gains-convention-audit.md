Note: Both capital-gains-realizations conventions elicited independently under prompt v4. Under the identity epsilon_taxrate = -(tau / (1 - tau)) * epsilon_netoftax, any model whose two answers are jointly consistent with a single tau prior implies one specific tau. The implied-tau column reports the median and 90 percent interval of 1000 bootstrap draws that independently sample one tax-rate run and one net-of-tax-rate run from the 15 runs of each; this is not the plug-in ratio of medians, which differs from the bootstrap median because tau = -rho / (1 - rho) is nonlinear in rho (Jensen's inequality). The band flag is computed against the bootstrap median. 'LTCG-rate consistent' marks an implied median tau in [0.15, 0.37] (U.S. top-bracket long-term-capital-gains envelope, federal LTCG plus NIIT plus high state); 'ordinary-income-rate consistent' marks (0.37, 0.55] (federal ordinary-income top plus high state); 'plausible sign, outside bands' marks (0, 1) outside both windows; and 'out of band' marks a non-positive or > 1 median tau. The shared-tau coherence column flags the joint sign pattern of the two pooled medians: a model with (tax < 0, net > 0) is sign-consistent with the identity, whereas (both positive, both negative, or reversed) indicates that the two answers are not jointly consistent with a single tau prior — either because the model holds two independent literature anchors, or because one convention was answered with the opposite sign.
