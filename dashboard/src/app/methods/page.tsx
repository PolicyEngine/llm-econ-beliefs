            A memory-only prompt fixes each quantity&apos;s interpretation and
            requests structured JSON: a point estimate, five quantiles (p05,
            p25, p50, p75, p95), citations, and a reasoning summary. The
            prompt instructs the model to answer from background knowledge
            alone — no tools, no literature reconstruction. Two
            sign-ambiguous quantities carry direction-first clarifiers that
            define what the reported sign means without calling either
            direction correct.

          <MethodBlock title="How the nine headline elasticities were chosen">
            Three criteria, fixed in the registry before the panel ran: each
            quantity is a standard named object with a published review anchor
            or an established calibration home; each has a direct policy
            consumer (six labor-and-tax parameters feed CBO-style and
            PolicyEngine-style tax-benefit microsimulation, three
            macro-and-trade parameters are core calibration inputs); and the
            two subpanels pair a domain where lower elasticities read as more
            room for redistribution with one where no such monotone mapping
            exists. Selection determines coverage, not model comparisons —
            every model answers the identical panel. Each quantity&apos;s page
            opens with the exact definition the models received.
          </MethodBlock>
          <MethodBlock title="Repeated runs and pooling">
            Each model-quantity cell runs 15 independent times. Each
            run&apos;s quantiles become a piecewise-uniform distribution;
            the pooled predictive distribution is the equal-weight mixture of
            the 15. The headline interval is the pooled 90 percent mixture
            interval — the predictive spread of repeated elicited answers,
            not a confidence interval for their mean. REML and Bayesian
            hierarchical estimators run alongside as robustness checks.

            26 models from nine organizations — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google,
            xAI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, Moonshot AI, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax —
            elicited in five waves: 11 in April 2026 and 15 in July 2026
            (six frontier updates, five Chinese-lab models, the GPT-5.6
            family, and a late Grok 4.5 addition), all under identical
            prompts. 26 U.S.-scoped quantities: 9 headline elasticities in
            two subpanels, 4 calibration parameters, a capital-gains
            convention sibling, and 12 simulation-facing coefficients.
            10,140 successful runs at a 100 percent parse rate, with every
            cell verified against the exact 15-run grid; failed slots re-ran as fresh independent draws,
